# Traffic Sign Recognition


## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a robust Traffic Sign Recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately detect and classify traffic signs from images or video feeds, contributing to enhanced road safety and intelligent transportation systems.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques for traffic sign identification.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for effective recognition.
- **Real-time Processing:** Designed for real-time processing to support applications in live traffic scenarios.
- **Convutional Nural Network:** Robust to traffic signal verification reliable performance under different conditions.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on a deep neural network tenserflow and keras and is designed for traffic signal feature extraction and validation of traffic sign recognition prediction.

## Installation
